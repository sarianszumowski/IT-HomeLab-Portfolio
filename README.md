### 1.1. Goal and Hypervisor Selection
* **Goal:** To create a stable and isolated testing environment for Project 2 (Active Directory).
* **Selected System:** Oracle VirtualBox (Chosen due to compatibility with the Windows Home edition host OS).

### 1.2. Host Requirements Verification
* **Host OS Version:** Windows 11 Home. (Confirmed that Hyper-V is not available, necessitating the use of VirtualBox).
